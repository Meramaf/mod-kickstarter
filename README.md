# Features
The kickstarter is an npc spawned in the world that allows players to instantly level up to 60, or 70, and receive a set of uncommon equipment. At level 60 and 70, players will receive all flight paths in Eastern Kingdom and Kalimdor and at level 70 they will also receive those in Outland. The players will also receive any required proficiencies, those will also be set to their max value.

There is a config option to determine the level the player is set to.
There is also a config option to require tokens to use the feature. Those tokens are added by updating the included `mod_kickstarter_tokens` table. A command to do this will be added in the future but does not have a high priority.

# Note
This module is still in testing and I can't guarantee its stability. There may be issues with certain features that I have yet to discover.
