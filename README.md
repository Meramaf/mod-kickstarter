# Features
The kickstarter is an npc spawned in the world that allows players to instantly level up to 60, 70 or 80 and receive a set of uncommon equipment.

At level 60, 70 and 80 the player will unlock all flight paths in Eastern Kingdom and Kalimdor. At level 70 and 80 the player will unlock all flight paths in Outland. At level 80 the player will unlock all flight paths in Northrend.

The players will receive any proficiencies required to support the equipment they get and they will also be set to their max value.

The player can be given a certain amount of gold when using the feature to help them get started.

There is a config option to require tokens to use the feature. Those tokens are added by updating the included `mod_kickstarter_tokens` table. A command to do this will be added in the future but does not have a high priority.

# Note
This module is still in a testing phase and I can't guarantee its stability. There may be issues with certain features that I have yet to discover.

The code is kind of messy but it gets the job done and that's the most important thing to me. I take no responsibility for your personal experience as this is delivered as-is but will receive bugfixes and improvements.

I created this because I've leveled so much over the years and I got sick of it, to the point where I'd rather start at a certain level and go from there. It is however also useful for testing purposes.
